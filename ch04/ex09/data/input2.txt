On a cold winter of morning
In the time before the light
In flames of death s eternal reign
We ride towards the fight

When the darkness is falling down
And the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter
Falls around the world tonight

Fightin  hard fightin  on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The skeletors souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores

On the blackest wings in hell s domain
We watch the lands become
In fire and flame and once again we know

So now we re flying we re free
We re free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness
Our quest carries on

Far beyond the sun down far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

So far away we wait for the day
For the light source so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and flames we carry on

As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They ll raise their hands
To the heavens above
Who descend unto their lies

Running back through the mid morning light
There s a burning in my heart
We re banished from the time in the foreign land
To a light beyond the stars

In your blackest dreams see to the need that destiny is tied
And endlessly we re roaming free tonight

And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation now the time has gone
Lost inside you ll never find lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

So far away we wait for the day
For the light source so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and flames we carry on

Whoa s

Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand
I ll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

So far away we wait for the day
For the light source so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and flames we carry on
